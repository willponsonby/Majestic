Earlier this year (2019), the UK wine company Majestic agreed to sell off its retail stores to Fortress Investment Group for £95 million as it shifted its focus to its online subscription service Naked Wines, bought for £70 million in 2015. This sale, to be completed after Christmas, will free up capital to be directed at Naked Wines and represents a further shift in the evolution of Majestic towards online retail. Josh Lincoln, the managing director of Majestic, calls it a growing sector, with wine sales in the £8 - £15 range growing faster than cheaper wines. What with Majestic's increasing focus on their online presence, I decided to scrape their website for data on pricing and customer satisfaction to see if I could glean anything from their business model.
